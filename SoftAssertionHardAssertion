Soft Assertion Hard Assertion

-> Assert => is a class that comes from testing framework/library and it has
different types of assertion methods:
ex: assertEquals(actualResult, expectedResult);4
    assertTrue(boolean);
    assertFalse(boolean);
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hard assertions => terminates the test execution when it fails.
It only terminates the execution of @Test annotation

SoftAssert => class that comes from TestNG and it handles the soft assertions.
Soft assertions => Doesn`t terminate the test execution even it fails.
It simply memorizes which assertion failed.
assertAll ==> a method that comes from SoftAssert class and it reports all the 
memorized failures.

Unless you use assertAll method explicitly in the end of the test it doesn`t report
failures.

Soft assertion can generate invalid report. Be careful!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      findElement() vs findElements()

findElement ===> this method returns WebElement type.
findElements ==> returns List<WebElement>

Utility classes ==> generic
Report ==>

custom message is a last argument of an assertion
(having a proper message is very important)

VERIFICATION is a soft assertion
ASSERTION is hard assertion
